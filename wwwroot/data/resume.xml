                Designed and built an industrial HMI application for monitoring conveyor belt systems in real-time using WCF, MVC,
                        SignalR, and HTML5 canvas, replacing a Windows 95 thick client application that had reliance on Visio and other third
                        party controls â€“ simplifying our deployment and licensing models.
            </detail>
            <detail>
                Developed a HTML5 canvas based Visio-like editor for mapping and configuring conveyor systems, eliminating the tedious
                            and error prone task of building configurations by hand. The application, built on paper.js, allowed for manipulation
                            and placement of complex shapes, editing properties, mapping of conveyor machine status to individual shapes, as
                            well as importing and exporting of map data.

                            by the Gartner research group.

                Designed and developed a product brochure site framework using MVC3, driven by a number of XML configuration file as well as storing content local to the site and in a database. The sites content is easily modifiable via a built in HTML editor, while more permanent fixtures and areas of the site could be modified via the XML files. Components can be dynamically loaded via the XML configuration for areas of the sites, different version of product detail could be swapped in and out, content pages can dynamically be added to navigation.

              Replaced slow SQL server based product search with a near real-time search implementation using the open source Lucene.Net search library, AJAX, and client-side templating via jQuery. 
Maintained a customer facing web application for the company's gold recycling program used by jewelry retailers (Jewelry Television, Helzberg Gold, CashOrTrade.com).  Refactored the app to support multiple versions of the site to run as one application that automatically changed themes and configuration based on the domain name that was requested. This change made managing the code base easier and allowed for new retailers to be added in a matter of days.
